# Backup Summary - Chat Demo Implementation
**Date:** January 12, 2025
**Purpose:** Backup of chat functionality changes to show only saved recipes and demo improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Chat Service Modified to Show Only Saved Recipes
**File:** `/backend_gateway/services/openai_chat_service.py`

#### Key Changes:
- Modified to fetch ALL saved recipes (up to 50) instead of generating AI recipes
- Added large DEMO MODE comment block explaining the changes
- Updated response messages to clearly indicate these are saved recipes from "My Recipes"
- Added fallback message when no saved recipes exist
- Removed hardcoded burger recipe that was artificially producing pictures

#### Implementation Details:
```python
# Step 2.5: Fetch ALL saved recipes
saved_recipes = await self._fetch_saved_recipes(user_id, limit=50)

# Step 3: SKIP OpenAI recipe generation - use only saved recipes
openai_recipes = []  # No AI recipes - DEMO MODE

# Use only saved recipes
all_recipes = saved_recipes
```

### 2. Chat Router Updated
**File:** `/backend_gateway/routers/chat_router.py`

#### Changes:
- Modified routing to always use OpenAI service (which now shows saved recipes)
- Removed CrewAI routing for recipe requests

```python
if engine == Engine.auto:
    intent = classify_intent(chat_message.message)
    engine = Engine.openai  # Always use OpenAI for now
```

### 3. Pantry Items Updated to Whole Numbers
**User:** 111
**Action:** All pantry quantities converted to whole numbers

#### Original Items (12 total):
- All items already had whole number quantities (10 each)

#### New Items Added (7 items):
- Sliced almonds: 1 cup
- Butter: 1 cup  
- Eggs: 1 each
- All-purpose flour: 2 cups
- Potatoes: 500 grams
- Salmon: 1 can
- Tuna flakes: 1 can

**Total pantry items:** 19

### 4. Recipe Completion Flow
**Previously Fixed Issues:**
- AI recipes now use exact pantry ingredients
- Recipe completion properly consumes ingredients
- Success modal shows quantity changes
- Removed warning messages from completion

## Database Changes

### Pantry Items Table
- Added 7 new items for user 111
- All quantities are whole numbers
- Items have appropriate expiration dates based on category

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files:
1. `/backend_gateway/services/openai_chat_service.py` - Main chat service changes
2. `/backend_gateway/routers/chat_router.py` - Routing logic changes
3. `/ios-app/app/chat-modal.tsx` - Frontend personalization (from previous session)
4. `/ios-app/app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` - Delete functionality fix (from previous session)

### Scripts Created:
1. `/update_pantry_quantities.py` - Update quantities to whole numbers
2. `/add_new_pantry_items.py` - Add new pantry items
3. `/check_pantry.py` - Check pantry status
4. `/save_demo_recipes.py` - Attempt to save demo recipes

## Testing Commands

### Check Chat Functionality:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What can I make for dinner?",
    "user_id": 111
  }'
```

### Check Pantry Items:
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/pantry/items?user_id=111"
```

### Check Saved Recipes:
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8001/user-recipes/111"
```

## Rollback Instructions

To revert to AI recipe generation:

1. **Edit `/backend_gateway/services/openai_chat_service.py`:**
   - Remove the demo mode code block (lines 184-199)
   - Restore original Step 3 code:
   ```python
   # Step 3: Generate OpenAI recipes
   num_ai_recipes = max(10 - len(saved_recipes), 8)
   openai_recipes = await self._generate_openai_recipes(
       valid_items, message, user_preferences, 
       num_recipes=num_ai_recipes * 2, 
       saved_recipes=saved_recipes
   )
   
   # Combine saved + AI recipes
   all_recipes = saved_recipes + openai_recipes
   ```

2. **Edit `/backend_gateway/routers/chat_router.py`:**
   - Restore original routing logic:
   ```python
   if engine == Engine.auto:
       intent = classify_intent(chat_message.message)
       engine = Engine.crewai if intent == "recipe_request" else Engine.openai
   ```

## Running the Application

### Using Smart Launcher:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python run_app_smart.py --backend
```

### Standard Launch:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python run_app.py
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

1. **No recipes showing in chat:**
   - User has no saved recipes
   - Solution: Save recipes from the Recipes tab first

2. **Backend port conflicts:**
   - Use `run_app_smart.py` which automatically finds available ports

3. **Database connection issues:**
   - Ensure using GCP credentials from `.env`
   - Database is `prepsense` on Google Cloud SQL

## Demo Instructions

1. **For demos showing saved recipes only:**
   - Current implementation is ready
   - Chat will only show recipes user has saved in "My Recipes"
   - If no saved recipes, appropriate message is shown

2. **To add demo recipes:**
   - Navigate to Recipes tab
   - Browse and save recipes
   - Return to chat to see saved recipes

## Environment Configuration
- Main `.env` file: `/Users/danielkim/_Capstone/PrepSense/.env`
- Contains GCP database credentials and API keys
- Backend reads from project root, not `backend_gateway/.env`
