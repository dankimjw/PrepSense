# Chat Demo Backup - January 12, 2025

## 📦 Backup Contents

This backup contains all changes made to implement the chat demo functionality where only saved recipes are shown instead of AI-generated recipes.

### Files Included:
- `BACKUP_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed documentation of all changes
- `openai_chat_service.py.backup` - Modified chat service (shows only saved recipes)
- `chat_router.py.backup` - Modified router (uses OpenAI service)
- `database_snapshot.json` - Current database state for user 111
- `restore_backup.sh` - Script to restore this backup
- Utility scripts for pantry management

### Database State (User 111):
- **Pantry Items:** 19 (all whole numbers)
- **Saved Recipes:** 11
- **User Preferences:** Not set

## 🔄 How to Restore

```bash
# Run the restore script
./restore_backup.sh

# Or manually copy files:
cp openai_chat_service.py.backup ../../backend_gateway/services/openai_chat_service.py
cp chat_router.py.backup ../../backend_gateway/routers/chat_router.py

# Restart backend
cd ../..
python run_app_smart.py --backend
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

1. **Chat shows only saved recipes**
   - No AI generation
   - Fetches up to 50 saved recipes
   - Shows appropriate message if no recipes saved

2. **Pantry with whole numbers**
   - All 19 items have whole number quantities
   - Includes new ingredients for demo recipes

3. **Demo mode clearly marked**
   - Large comment block in code
   - Easy to revert to AI generation

## ⚡ Quick Test

```bash
# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What can I make?", "user_id": 111}'

# Check pantry
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/pantry/items?user_id=111"

# Check saved recipes
curl "http://localhost:8001/user-recipes/111"
```

## 📝 Notes

- Backend must be running on port 8001
- Database is on Google Cloud SQL (not local)
- User 111 is the demo user
- All changes are reversible using restore script
