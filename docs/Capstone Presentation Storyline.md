### **3\. The Problem at Scale**

**Slide Title: *"A Global Issue Starts at Home"***

**Frame the facts (Image 1\) as not just shocking, but deeply personal:**

* **“Every year, we waste 91M tons of food in the U.S.—but this isn’t just a statistic, it’s your fridge, your wallet, your habits.”**

**Then transition:**

### **4\. Meet Lily – Our Everyday Reality**

**Slide Title: *"Lily’s Life Is Our Life"***  
 **Merge Images 2 and 3 → Frame as a user story (light UX journey tone)**

**Lily, a sustainability-conscious grad student in Dallas, shops once a week, prefers home-cooked meals, and has tried every food tracking app on the market.**

**Overlay the typical quotes from Image 2:**

* **"I don’t remember what’s in the fridge"**

* **"I feel guilty throwing food away"**

* **"What do I make tonight?"**

**Each quote → gently mapped to a frustration (manual tracking, expiry, waste, decision fatigue)**

**End the slide with:**

***“What Lily needs isn’t another list or reminder. She needs a system that thinks with her.”***

### **5\. The “As-Is” Pain Point Loop**

**Slide Title: *"Why We Keep Wasting Food"***

**Quick visual: a loop diagram**

1. **Buy with best intentions**

2. **Forget or misplace**

3. **Something goes bad**

4. **Waste → regret → repeat**

**Introduce:**

***“PrepSense breaks this loop. Not with more effort, but with smarter help.”***
