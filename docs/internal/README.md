## üîÑ Development Workflow Integration

These internal docs are tightly integrated with the development workflow:

1. **Claude instances** read these files for configuration and validation rules
2. **Session summaries** track what was implemented, tested, and needs verification  
3. **Testing documentation** provides detailed results and edge case analysis
4. **Workflow docs** enable multi-instance collaboration and task coordination

- [workflows/SUBAGENT_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md](./workflows/SUBAGENT_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md) - When to use agents

### For Development Progress
- [sessions/](./sessions/) - All session summaries and progress logs
- [testing/](./testing/) - Test results and validation reports
- [workflows/backlog.md](./workflows/backlog.md) - Internal task tracking

### For Technical Deep Dives

## üìä Usage Guidelines

### For Daniel (Project Owner)  
- Review session summaries to track progress
- Use testing docs to understand current implementation state
- Reference workflow docs for development process optimization
- Check database docs for schema and migration planning

### For Claude Instances
- **ALWAYS** read relevant validation rules before making claims
- Update session summaries after significant work
- Document test results and edge cases discovered
- Follow workflow protocols for multi-instance collaboration

### For Development Team (if expanded)
- These docs provide context on development decisions
- Session summaries show the evolution of implementation
- Testing docs reveal known issues and edge cases
- Workflow docs explain the development process

## üîí Security & Privacy

These internal docs may contain:
- API keys and configuration details
- Database connection information  
- Internal development processes
- Debugging information with sensitive data

**Never commit sensitive information to public repositories.**

## üóÇÔ∏è File Organization Standards

- **Session files**: Use date format `2025-MM-DD-description.md`
- **Testing files**: Prefix with test type (e.g., `RECIPE_COMPLETION_TEST_RESULTS.md`)
- **Workflow files**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `WORKTREE_NOTES_MAIN.md`)
- **Database files**: Include validation/migration in filename when applicable
