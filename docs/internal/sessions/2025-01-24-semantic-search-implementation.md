# Semantic Search Implementation for PrepSense

## Date: 2025-01-24
## Summary

Implemented semantic search functionality for PrepSense using PostgreSQL with pgvector extension, enabling intelligent search across recipes, products, and pantry items using vector embeddings.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Embedding Service** (`backend_gateway/services/embedding_service.py`)
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model integration (1536 dimensions)
- Specialized embedding generation for recipes, products, and pantry items
- Batch processing support with rate limiting
- Cosine similarity calculation utilities

### 2. **Database Migration** (`backend_gateway/migrations/add_vector_embeddings.sql`)
- pgvector extension setup
- Added vector columns to recipes, products, and pantry_items tables
- Created HNSW indexes for fast similarity search
- Added specialized tables for caching and analytics
- PostgreSQL functions for semantic and hybrid search

### 3. **PostgreSQL Service Updates** (`backend_gateway/services/postgres_service.py`)
- Added async methods for semantic search operations:
  - `semantic_search_recipes()` - Pure semantic recipe search
  - `semantic_search_products()` - Product similarity search
  - `hybrid_recipe_search()` - Combined semantic + ingredient matching
  - `find_similar_pantry_items()` - Find duplicate/similar items
  - Embedding update methods for individual entities
  - Search query logging for analytics

### 4. **Embedding Population Script** (`backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py`)
- Batch processing for existing data
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Command-line interface for selective updates
- Support for individual entity updates

### 5. **API Endpoints** (`backend_gateway/routers/semantic_search_router.py`)
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/recipes` - Semantic recipe search
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/recipes/hybrid` - Hybrid search with ingredient matching
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/products` - Product search
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/pantry/similar/{item_name}` - Find similar pantry items
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/update-embedding/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` - Update embeddings
- `/api/v1/semantic-search/search-analytics` - User search analytics

## Key Features

### Semantic Search
- Finds conceptually similar items even without exact keyword matches
- Uses OpenAI embeddings for understanding context and meaning
- HNSW indexing for sub-second query performance

### Hybrid Search
- Combines semantic understanding with ingredient availability
- Weighted scoring system (configurable semantic vs ingredient weights)
- Returns matched/missing ingredients for each recipe

### Analytics & Learning
- Logs all searches with embeddings for pattern analysis
- Tracks user clicks to improve relevance
- Enables finding similar past searches

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Connect to your Google Cloud SQL instance and run:
```sql
-- Run the migration file
\i backend_gateway/migrations/add_vector_embeddings.sql
```

### 2. Set OpenAI API Key
Ensure your environment has the OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### 3. Populate Initial Embeddings
```bash
# Populate all embeddings
python backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py

# Or populate specific types
python backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py recipes
python backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py products
python backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py pantry

# Update specific entity
python backend_gateway/scripts/populate_embeddings.py recipe 123
```

## Usage Examples

### Semantic Recipe Search
```python
# Find recipes similar to "healthy breakfast"
POST /api/v1/semantic-search/recipes
{
    "query": "healthy breakfast",
    "limit": 10,
    "similarity_threshold": 0.3
}
```

### Hybrid Recipe Search
```python
# Find recipes for "Italian dinner" using available ingredients
POST /api/v1/semantic-search/recipes/hybrid
{
    "query": "Italian dinner",
    "available_ingredients": ["tomatoes", "pasta", "garlic", "olive oil"],
    "limit": 10,
    "semantic_weight": 0.6,
    "ingredient_weight": 0.4
}
```

### Find Similar Pantry Items
```python
# Find items similar to "whole wheat bread"
GET /api/v1/semantic-search/pantry/similar/whole wheat bread?limit=5
```

## Performance Considerations

- HNSW indexes provide fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- Initial embedding generation takes ~0.5-1 second per item
- Search queries execute in <100ms with proper indexing
- Consider batch processing for large datasets

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: ⚠️ **NEEDS TESTING** - Run comprehensive tests for semantic search functionality
   - Use `test_semantic_search_api.py` for full API testing with auth
   - Use `test_semantic_search_standalone.py` for quick database-level testing
   - Verify all endpoints work correctly with the frontend
2. **UI Integration**: Add semantic search to the iOS app
3. **Feedback Loop**: Implement click-through tracking to improve relevance
4. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for frequently searched queries
5. **Advanced Features**:
   - Multi-modal search (text + images)
   - Personalized embeddings based on user preferences
   - Real-time embedding updates on data changes

## Testing Status

### ⚠️ REQUIRES TESTING
- **API Endpoints**: Need to verify all endpoints work with proper authentication
- **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
- **Performance**: Validate sub-100ms query times under load
- **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing PrepSense features

## Technical Notes

- Uses pgvector with HNSW indexing for performance
- Embeddings are 1536-dimensional vectors from OpenAI
- Cosine similarity metric for all similarity calculations
- Supports partial index updates for efficiency
- Thread-safe with connection pooling
