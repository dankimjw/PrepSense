# Development Session Summary - January 19, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Recipe Filter Not Working
**Problem**: When clicking the thumbs down filter in My Recipes, it was showing thumbs up recipes (e.g., "Classic Spaghetti Carbonara" instead of "Chocolate Lava Cake")

**Root Cause**: The `fetchMyRecipes()` function wasn't being called when the filter changed

**Solution**: Added a separate `useEffect` hook that watches for `myRecipesFilter` changes
```typescript
// app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx:769-773
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === 'my-recipes') {
    fetchMyRecipes();
  }
}, [myRecipesFilter]);
```

### 2. Inaccurate Ingredient Counts
**Problem**: Recipe cards showing incorrect "have" and "missing" ingredient counts (e.g., "2 have • 1 missing" when the actual counts were different)

**Root Cause**: When using allergen filtering, the backend was guessing ingredient counts by checking if ingredient names appeared in the recipe title

**Solution**: 
- Added `get_recipe_information_bulk()` method to fetch full recipe details
- Properly calculate ingredient counts based on actual recipe ingredients vs pantry items
- Backend now fetches complete ingredient lists for accurate counting

### 3. Recipe Save Error (500 Internal Server Error)
**Problem**: Getting 500 error when trying to save or favorite recipes

**Root Cause**: Backend code referenced new database columns (status, cooked_at) that didn't exist yet

**Solution**: Temporarily commented out references to these fields until database migration is run

### 4. Backend Config Directory Missing in Worktrees
**Problem**: `backend_gateway/config/` directory wasn't being tracked by git due to broad `config/` pattern in .gitignore

**Solution**: 
- Added exception rule `!backend_gateway/config/` to .gitignore
- Added the config files to git tracking
- Verified no secrets were in these files (only code structure)

## New Features Implemented

### Bookmark/Saved/Cooked Recipe System (Foundation)
Based on the provided requirements, implemented backend support for:
- **Status field**: `saved` (bookmarked) or `cooked` (already made)
- **Cooked_at timestamp**: Track when recipe was actually cooked
- **Mark as cooked method**: Update recipe status when user completes cooking

**Database Migration** (`update_user_recipes_status.sql`):
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_recipes 
ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'saved' 
CHECK (status IN ('saved', 'cooked'));

ALTER TABLE user_recipes 
ADD COLUMN cooked_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

## Git Worktree Management
- Learned about git worktrees vs branches
- Each worktree is a separate directory with its own:
  - Working files
  - node_modules (need separate `npm install`)
  - Build artifacts
- Can run multiple iOS simulators from different worktrees

## Pull Requests Created
1. **PR #57**: Fix recipe filter not updating when thumbs down selected
2. **PR #58**: Fix recipe save error and improve ingredient count calculation

## Next Steps
1. Run the database migration script to enable status/cooked_at columns
2. Implement frontend UI for Saved/Cooked tabs in My Recipes
3. Update rating system to only show after cooking
4. Add auto-promotion from Saved → Cooked when cooking flow completes
5. Fix any issues with preparation/cooking times appearing in ingredient lists
