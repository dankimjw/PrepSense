# Simplified AI Recipe Enhancement (Without Taste Profiles)

## What We Need to Add to OpenAI Recipes

### 1. **Complete Nutrition Data** ⭐ ESSENTIAL
Currently we only get calories and protein. We need:
```json
"nutrition": {
  "calories": 420,
  "protein": 35,      // grams
  "carbs": 45,        // grams
  "fat": 18,          // grams
  "fiber": 8,         // grams
  "sugar": 12,        // grams
  "sodium": 650       // milligrams
}
```

### 2. **Difficulty Information** ⭐ USEFUL
```json
"difficulty": {
  "level": "easy",           // easy, intermediate, or advanced
  "prep_time": 10,           // minutes
  "cook_time": 20,           // minutes
  "total_time": 30           // minutes (should equal readyInMinutes)
}
```

### 3. **Tags for Better Filtering** ⭐ USEFUL
```json
"tags": ["quick", "one-pot", "family-friendly", "meal-prep"]
```

## Updated Prompt Addition

Add this to the existing prompt in `crew_ai_service.py`:

```python
# In the prompt, update the recipe format example:

Example of ONE recipe in the correct format:
{
  "id": "ai-recipe-1",
  "title": "Creamy Garlic Pasta",
  "readyInMinutes": 25,
  "servings": 4,
  "summary": "A quick and delicious pasta dish with creamy garlic sauce",
  "extendedIngredients": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "pasta",
      "original": "1 pound pasta",
      "amount": 1,
      "unit": "pound"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "garlic",
      "original": "4 cloves garlic, minced",
      "amount": 4,
      "unit": "cloves"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "step": "Bring a large pot of salted water to boil"
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "step": "Cook pasta according to package directions"
    }
  ],
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": 420,
    "protein": 15,
    "carbs": 65,
    "fat": 12,
    "fiber": 3,
    "sugar": 4,
    "sodium": 380
  },
  "difficulty": {
    "level": "easy",
    "prep_time": 10,
    "cook_time": 15,
    "total_time": 25
  },
  "meal_type": "dinner",
  "cuisine_type": "italian",
  "dietary_tags": ["vegetarian"],
  "tags": ["quick", "easy", "weeknight", "pasta"]
}

NUTRITION ESTIMATION GUIDELINES:
- Base on standard portion sizes
- Consider all ingredients including oils, butter, seasonings
- Account for cooking method (grilling = less fat, frying = more fat)
- Include realistic sodium from salt and ingredients

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- Easy: < 5 main ingredients, < 30 min, basic techniques (boiling, mixing, baking)
- Intermediate: 5-10 ingredients, 30-60 min, moderate skills (sautéing, roasting)
- Advanced: > 10 ingredients, > 60 min, complex techniques (braising, tempering)
```

## Benefits of This Simplified Approach

### 1. **Better Nutritional Tracking**
- Users can track macros for fitness goals
- Support low-carb, high-protein diets
- Monitor sodium for health conditions
- Track fiber for digestive health

### 2. **Recipe Filtering**
- Filter by cooking time for busy weeknights
- Filter by difficulty for skill level
- Use tags for meal planning (meal-prep, one-pot)

### 3. **No Complex Taste Analysis**
- Simpler implementation
- Less token usage
- Still compatible with Spoonacular recipes

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Update AI Prompt (Do Now)
1. Add nutrition fields to prompt
2. Add difficulty information
3. Add tags array
4. Test with a few recipe generations

### Phase 2: Use the Data (After Ingredient Subtraction)
1. Create nutrition summary views
2. Add difficulty filters to recipe search
3. Use tags for recipe organization
4. Track user patterns without taste profiles

## Alternative Preference Learning (Without Taste)

Instead of taste profiles, we can learn preferences from:

1. **Recipe Ratings** - 5-star rating system
2. **Cooking Frequency** - Which recipes get cooked repeatedly
3. **Recipe Categories** - Track preferred cuisines, meal types
4. **Nutritional Patterns** - Learn macro preferences
5. **Time Preferences** - Quick meals vs. elaborate cooking
6. **Ingredient Patterns** - Frequently used ingredients

## Token Usage Impact

The simplified enhancement adds approximately:
- Input: +200 tokens (nutrition and difficulty guidelines)
- Output: +50 tokens per recipe (additional fields)

For 5 recipes:
- Current: ~2000 tokens
- Enhanced: ~2450 tokens (only 22% increase)

This is very reasonable for the added value.

## Next Steps

1. Update the AI recipe prompt with nutrition and difficulty
2. Test the enhanced recipe generation
3. Proceed with ingredient subtraction implementation
4. Build preference learning based on ratings and behavior
