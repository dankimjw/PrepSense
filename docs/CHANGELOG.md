## 2025-01-16 - Unit Conversion System Overhaul

### Fixed: Unit Conversion Errors for Eggs and Broccoli

**Problem**: Recipe completion was failing when ingredients had descriptive words like "4 large eggs" or "2 cups fresh broccoli" because the system was treating "large" and "fresh" as units instead of descriptors.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Enhanced Spoonacular Integration** (`backend_gateway/services/spoonacular_service.py`)
   - Added `parse_ingredients()` method that correctly identifies descriptive words as metadata, not units
   - Implemented `convert_amount()` for ingredient-specific unit conversions
   - Added mock functionality for testing without API calls

2. **Created AI-Powered Unit Conversion Service** (`backend_gateway/services/unit_conversion_service.py`)
   - Built intelligent conversion with multiple fallback strategies:
     1. Spoonacular API (95% confidence)
     2. Internal conversion system (85% confidence)
     3. AI agent conversion (70% confidence)
     4. Fallback with warning (0% confidence)
   - Handles edge cases like "large" ‚Üí "each" for countable items

3. **Updated Frontend Parser** (`ios-app/utils/ingredientParser.ts`)
   - Added list of descriptive words: ['large', 'medium', 'small', 'fresh', 'ripe', 'frozen', etc.]
   - Modified parsing logic to detect descriptors and prevent treating them as units
   - Better regex patterns for "4 large eggs" type ingredients

4. **Enhanced Recipe Completion Service** (`backend_gateway/services/recipe_completion_service.py`)
   - Integrated new unit conversion service in `calculate_quantity_to_use()`
   - Added ingredient name parameter for context-aware conversions
   - Improved error handling with detailed conversion metadata

5. **Added New API Endpoints** (`backend_gateway/routers/pantry_router.py`)
   - `POST /api/v1/pantry/validate-unit` - Validates if a unit is appropriate for an ingredient
   - `POST /api/v1/pantry/convert-unit` - Intelligent unit conversion
   - `POST /api/v1/pantry/parse-ingredients` - Parse ingredient strings with proper unit handling

**Result**: System now correctly handles:
- "4 large eggs" ‚Üí 4 each eggs
- "2 cups fresh broccoli" ‚Üí 2 cups broccoli  
- "3 medium onions" ‚Üí 3 each onions

### Added: Unit Validation in UI

**Problem**: Users could select inappropriate units for items (e.g., "kg" for eggs, "each" for milk).

**Changes Made**:

1. **Real-time Unit Validation** (`ios-app/app/add-item.tsx`)
   - Added `useEffect` hook that validates unit when item name or unit changes
   - Calls `/api/v1/pantry/validate-unit` endpoint
   - Shows visual feedback: red warning icon (‚ö†Ô∏è) for invalid units
   - Loading spinner while validating

2. **Smart Unit Suggestions**
   - When invalid unit detected, shows alert with recommended units
   - User can choose to "Keep Current" or "Use Recommended"
   - Displays suggested units below the unit selector

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Invalid units show in red color (#EF4444)
   - Warning icon appears next to invalid units
   - Helper text shows suggested units

**How it works**:
1. User types "eggs" and selects "kg" as unit
2. System detects mismatch and shows warning
3. Alert suggests better units: "each, dozen, large, medium, small"
4. User can accept suggestion or keep their choice

### Optimized: API Call Efficiency

**Problem**: Unit validation was making API calls on every character typed.

**Solution**:
- Validation now only triggers when:
  1. User changes the unit (primary validation point)
  2. User finishes typing item name (onBlur event)
- Added caching to prevent duplicate validations
- Removed unnecessary debouncing

**Result**: 
- Before: 10+ API calls while typing "cereal bar"
- After: 1-2 API calls (on blur and unit change)

## 2025-01-15 - User Preferences System

### Added: Complete User Preferences for Allergens and Dietary Restrictions

1. Created preferences API endpoint with PostgreSQL persistence
2. Added UserPreferencesModal in mobile app
3. Integrated preferences with AI recipe recommendations
4. Fixed authentication issues with mock token support
