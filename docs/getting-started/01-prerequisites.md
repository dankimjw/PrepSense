2. Open Xcode once to accept licenses
3. Install additional components when prompted

### 6. Android Emulator (Optional)
For testing on Android devices.

**Installation:**

## üîç Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything is installed:

```bash
# Check Git
git --version

# Check Python
python3 --version

# Check pip (Python package manager)
pip3 --version

# Check Node.js
node --version

# Check npm
npm --version

# Check Expo CLI
expo --version
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### "Command not found" errors
- Make sure the tool is added to your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal
- On Windows, you might need to restart your computer

### Permission errors on macOS/Linux
- Use `sudo` for global installations
- Or use a version manager (like nvm for Node.js)

### Python issues
- Make sure you're using `python3` not `python`
- On Windows, you might need to use `py` instead

## ‚úÖ Ready to Continue?

Once you have all the tools installed, you're ready to move on to cloning the repository!
