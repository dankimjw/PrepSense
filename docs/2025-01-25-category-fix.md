# OCR Category Assignment Fix
Date: 2025-01-25

## Problem
When scanning items using the OCR feature, all items were being categorized as "dry_goods" regardless of what they actually were (milk → dry_goods, bananas → dry_goods, etc.)

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Vision Service** (`vision_service.py`) correctly identifies items with proper categories from OpenAI
   - OpenAI returns categories like "Dairy", "Produce", "Snacks", etc.
   - These are parsed correctly in `parse_openai_response()` at line 182

2. **OCR Router** (`ocr_router.py`) was overriding these categories
   - At line 508-516, it was calling `PracticalFoodCategorizationService` for ALL items
   - This service uses pattern matching that often fails

3. **Categorization Service** (`practical_food_categorization.py`) 
   - When pattern matching fails, defaults to "dry_goods" (line 290)
   - This was overwriting the correct categories from OpenAI

## Solution Implemented
Modified `ocr_router.py` to preserve OpenAI's category assignments:

```python
# Check if OpenAI already provided a category
openai_category = item.get("category")
if openai_category and openai_category != "Other":
    # Trust OpenAI's category assignment
    category = openai_category
    logger.info(f"Using OpenAI category for {product_name}: {category}")
else:
    # Only use categorization service if OpenAI didn't provide a category
    try:
        categorization_result = await categorization_service.categorize_food_item(product_name)
        category = categorization_result.category
    except Exception as cat_error:
        logger.error(f"Error categorizing {product_name}: {str(cat_error)}")
        category = "Other"
```

## Impact
- Items scanned via OCR now retain their correct categories
- OpenAI's intelligent categorization is preserved
- Fallback pattern matching only used when needed
- Better user experience with accurate item categorization

## Files Modified
- `/backend_gateway/routers/ocr_router.py` - Lines 508-522

## Testing
- Verified backend health check passes
- Categories from OpenAI Vision API are now preserved correctly
- Pattern matching service only used as fallback
