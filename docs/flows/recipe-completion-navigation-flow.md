# Recipe Completion Navigation Flow Documentation

## 1. User Flow

### Primary Navigation Paths to Recipe Completion

1. **Chat Screen → Recipe Detail → Cooking Mode → Recipe Completion**
   - User opens Chat tab (`/(tabs)/chat.tsx`)
   - User asks for recipe recommendations (e.g., "What can I make for dinner?")
   - AI responds with recipe cards displayed in chat
   - User taps on a recipe card → navigates to `/recipe-details` screen
   - User taps "Cook Now" button → navigates to `/cooking-mode` screen
   - User completes cooking steps and reaches final step
   - User taps "Complete" button → opens `RecipeCompletionModal`
   - User adjusts ingredient quantities and confirms → pantry items are deducted

2. **Chat Screen → Recipe Detail → Quick Complete**
   - User follows steps 1-4 from above to reach recipe detail screen
   - User taps "Quick" button (lightning icon) → opens `QuickCompleteModal`
   - User reviews auto-selected pantry items and confirms → recipe marked complete

3. **Recipes Tab → Recipe Detail → Cooking Mode → Recipe Completion**
   - User opens Recipes tab (`/(tabs)/recipes.tsx`)
   - User browses "From Pantry" or "Discover" sections
   - User taps on a recipe → navigates to `/recipe-details` screen
   - User follows same cooking mode flow as path #1

4. **Direct Test Screen (Development Only)**
   - User navigates to `/test-recipe-completion` screen
   - User taps "Open Recipe Completion Modal" → directly opens `RecipeCompletionModal`
   - Used for testing modal functionality

### Button Interactions and Gestures

- **Recipe Cards**: Tap to navigate to recipe details
- **Cook Now Button**: Large primary button → starts cooking mode
- **Quick Button**: Secondary button with lightning icon → instant completion flow
- **Complete Button**: Final step in cooking mode → opens recipe completion modal
- **Completion Confirm Button**: Blue button in modal → submits ingredient usage
- **Ingredient Sliders**: Drag to adjust quantities in completion modal
- **Quick Amount Buttons**: Tap "None", "1/4", "Half", "3/4", "All" for preset amounts

## 2. Data Flow

### Navigation Data Passing

```typescript
// Chat → Recipe Details
router.push({
  pathname: '/recipe-details',
  params: { recipe: JSON.stringify(recipe) }
});

// Recipe Details → Cooking Mode
router.push({
  pathname: '/cooking-mode',
  params: { 
    recipeId: normalizedRecipe.id,
    recipeData: JSON.stringify(normalizedRecipe)
  }
});

// Cooking Mode → Recipe Completion Modal (in-component state)
setShowCompletionModal(true);
```

### API Calls in Recipe Completion Flow

1. **Chat Message with Recipes**:
   ```typescript
   POST /api/v1/chat/message
   Body: { message, user_id: 111, use_preferences: true }
   Response: { response, recipes[] }
   ```

2. **Pantry Items Loading**:
   ```typescript
   GET /api/v1/pantry-items?user_id=111
   Response: PantryItem[]
   ```

3. **Recipe Completion Submission**:
   ```typescript
   POST /api/v1/recipes/complete
   Body: { user_id: 111, recipe_name, ingredients[] }
   Response: { summary, insufficient_items[], errors[] }
   ```

4. **Quick Complete Check**:
   ```typescript
   POST /recipe-consumption/check-ingredients
   Body: { user_id, recipe_id, servings }
   Response: { ingredients[] with pantry_matches }
   ```

5. **Quick Complete Submission**:
   ```typescript
   POST /recipe-consumption/quick-complete
   Body: { user_id, recipe_id, servings, ingredient_selections[] }
   Response: { success, message }
   ```

### State Management Flow

- **Recipe Data**: Passed through navigation params and stored in component state
- **Pantry Items**: Fetched on modal open and stored in component state
- **Ingredient Usage**: Calculated in modal and tracked with sliders/buttons
- **Completion Status**: Updates pantry database and marks recipe as cooked
