```json
{
  "id": "ai-recipe-1",  // String ID
  "title": "Recipe Title",
  "extendedIngredients": [  // Same format as Spoonacular
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "pasta",
      "original": "1 pound pasta",
      "amount": 1,
      "unit": "pound"

```

### Key Findings

1. **Good Alignment**: Both systems use the same `extendedIngredients` structure, which is critical for ingredient subtraction functionality.

2. **Frontend Flexibility**: The PrepSense frontend already handles both format variations gracefully.

3. **Data Storage**: Both formats are stored as-is in the JSONB `recipe_data` column, allowing flexibility.

- Cooking frequency
- Recipe modifications
- Search patterns
- Ingredient substitutions
- Time-of-day preferences

#### Preference Dimensions
```javascript
userPreferences = {
  taste: {
    sweetness: { preferred: 40, tolerance: 20 },
    spiciness: { preferred: 60, tolerance: 30 },
    // ... other taste dimensions
  },
  nutrition: {
    targetCalories: 2000,
    macroRatios: { protein: 30, carbs: 40, fat: 30 },
    restrictions: ["low-sodium", "high-fiber"]
  },
  cooking: {
    maxPrepTime: 30,
    skillLevel: "intermediate",
    preferredEquipment: ["instant-pot", "air-fryer"]
  },
  dietary: {
    diets: ["pescetarian"],
    intolerances: ["gluten", "dairy"],
    dislikes: ["mushrooms", "olives"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Recipe Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_recipe_score(recipe, user_preferences, context):
    scores = {
        'taste_match': calculate_taste_alignment(recipe.taste_profile, user_preferences.taste),
        'ingredient_availability': check_pantry_coverage(recipe.ingredients, user.pantry),
        'dietary_compliance': verify_dietary_restrictions(recipe, user_preferences.dietary),
        'nutrition_goals': assess_nutritional_fit(recipe.nutrition, user_preferences.nutrition),
        'cuisine_preference': match_cuisine_preference(recipe.cuisine, user_preferences.cuisines),
        'time_appropriateness': check_time_constraints(recipe.prep_time, context.available_time),
        'seasonal_relevance': calculate_seasonal_score(recipe, context.season),
        'cost_efficiency': evaluate_cost_effectiveness(recipe.cost, user_preferences.budget)
    }
    
    # Weighted scoring based on user priorities
    weights = user_preferences.scoring_weights or default_weights
    
    return sum(scores[key] * weights[key] for key in scores)
```

    user_id INTEGER,
    dimension VARCHAR(50),  -- sweetness, spiciness, etc.
    preferred_value FLOAT,
    min_value FLOAT,
    max_value FLOAT,
    confidence FLOAT,  -- How confident we are in this preference
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE recipe_interactions (
    user_id INTEGER,
    recipe_id VARCHAR(100),
    interaction_type VARCHAR(50),  -- viewed, cooked, rated, modified
    rating INTEGER,
    modifications JSONB,
    context JSONB,  -- time, weather, occasion
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE learned_preferences (
    user_id INTEGER,
    preference_type VARCHAR(100),
    preference_value JSONB,
    learning_source VARCHAR(50),  -- explicit, implicit, inferred
    confidence FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
