# Recipe Dataset Import Summary

## Overview
Successfully imported 256 curated recipes from the Kaggle Epicurious dataset into the PrepSense database for user 111.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- ✅ Renamed folder from `FoodIngreidnetsandRecipeDatasetwImages` to `kaggle-recipes-with-images`
- ✅ Analyzed dataset structure: 13,501 recipes with images
- ✅ Selected 256 balanced recipes covering:
  - **8 Cuisines**: Italian, Asian, Korean, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, Indian, Thai
  - **3 Meal Types**: Breakfast (78), Lunch (72), Dinner (106)
  - **4 Dietary Types**: Regular (103), Vegetarian (112), Vegan (32), Gluten-Free (9)

### 2. Database Import
- ✅ Created import script: `/scripts/import_recipe_dataset.py`
- ✅ Successfully imported all 256 recipes to `user_recipes` table
- ✅ Matched 241 recipes with their images (94% match rate)
- ✅ Stored images locally in `/backend_gateway/static/recipe_images/`
- ✅ Each recipe includes:
  - Full recipe data (title, ingredients, instructions)
  - High-quality images from Epicurious
  - Categorization (cuisine, meal type, dietary tags)
  - Allergen information
  - Nutritional estimates

### 3. Technical Details
- **Recipe IDs**: 10001-10256 (to avoid conflicts)
- **User ID**: 111 (demo user)
- **Source**: 'kaggle_dataset' (for tracking)
- **Status**: 'saved' (pre-saved recipes)
- **Images**: Stored as `/static/recipe_images/recipe_XXXXX.jpg`

### 4. PostgreSQL MCP Configuration
- ✅ Added PostgreSQL MCP server to all Claude instances
- ✅ Updated all worktree `.mcp.json` files
- ✅ Created documentation: `/docs/MCP_POSTGRES_SETUP.md`
- ✅ All Claude instances can now query the database directly

## Database Verification

```sql
-- Total recipes imported
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_recipes 
WHERE user_id = 111 AND source = 'kaggle_dataset';
-- Result: 256

-- Recipes with images
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_recipes 
WHERE user_id = 111 AND source = 'kaggle_dataset' 
AND recipe_image IS NOT NULL;
-- Result: 256 (all have image URLs)
```

## Next Steps
1. Verify recipes display correctly in iOS app
2. Test recipe search and filtering
3. Ensure images load properly from static server
4. Consider implementing image caching for performance
