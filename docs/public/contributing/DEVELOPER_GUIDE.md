# PrepSense Developer Guide

This guide outlines the controls and best practices in place to maintain code quality and prevent breaking changes.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production code (protected branch)
- `develop` - Integration branch for features (protected branch)
- `feature/*` - Feature branches (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Pull Requests
- All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR)
- PRs require at least one approved review
- All CI checks must pass before merging
- PRs must include tests for new features and bug fixes

## Code Quality Controls

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks automatically run checks before each commit:
- Code formatting with Black
- Linting with flake8 and ruff
- Type checking with mypy
- Security checks

To set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new code
- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Run tests locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=term-missing
  ```

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 with a line length of 127 characters
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Document public APIs with docstrings

## Feature Flags

Use feature flags to safely roll out new features:

```python
from feature_flags import with_feature_flag

def new_feature():
    return "New feature is active!"

def old_feature():
    return "Old feature is active"

# Use the feature flag
result = with_feature_flag(
    'ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE',
    new_feature,
    old_feature
)
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Logging
- Use the standard Python logging module
- Log levels:
  - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
  - INFO: General operational information
  - WARNING: Indicates potential issues
  - ERROR: Errors that don't prevent the application from running
  - CRITICAL: Critical errors that prevent the application from functioning

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor API response times
- Track database query performance
- Set up alerts for error rates exceeding thresholds

## Security
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Deployment
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Staging environment for testing before production
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Rollback procedures in place

## Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Maintain architecture diagrams
- Document known issues and workarounds
