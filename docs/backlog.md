## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE AUDIT - My Recipes Not Showing - August 6, 2025

**ISSUE**: User added mock recipes using `scripts/add_mock_recipes_and_ingredients.py` but they're not showing up in the My Recipes section of the Recipes screen.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: After comprehensive audit, identified **API connectivity mismatch** as primary issue:

| Issue | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Backend API Status** | ✅ WORKING | Backend running on port 8001, `/api/v1/user-recipes` returns 100 saved recipes |
| **Frontend Configuration** | ❌ MISCONFIGURED | iOS app config defaults to port 8002 when `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` not set |
| **Environment Variable** | ❌ NOT SET | `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` not configured, causing frontend to use wrong port |
| **Authentication Context** | ❌ HARDCODED | User ID hardcoded to 111 throughout app, no proper auth integration |
| **Recipe Data** | ✅ AVAILABLE | Mock script successfully added recipes to database for user_id 111 |

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY TASKS - Fix My Recipes Display

| 45 | **CRITICAL: Fix API Port Mismatch for My Recipes** | Todo | frontend | Critical | 🔴 CONCEPT | Frontend defaults to port 8002, backend runs on 8001. Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1 |
| 46 | **Verify My Recipes Tab API Connectivity** | Todo | frontend | High | 🔴 CONCEPT | Test RecipesContainer.tsx fetchMyRecipes() function connects to correct endpoint |
| 47 | **Debug Frontend My Recipes Data Flow** | Todo | frontend | High | 🔴 CONCEPT | Add console logging to track data flow from API call to UI display in My Recipes tab |
| 48 | **Validate User Authentication Context** | Todo | frontend | Medium | 🟡 PARTIAL | Ensure user_id 111 is correctly passed in API calls (currently hardcoded but may be inconsistent) |
| 49 | **Test Recipe Save Functionality Integration** | Todo | frontend | Medium | 🟡 PARTIAL | Add UI buttons to save recipes from Pantry/Discover tabs to My Recipes (backend endpoints exist) |

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FINDINGS

### ✅ Backend Status (Working)
- **API Endpoint**: `GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/user-recipes` returns 100 recipes
- **Mock Data**: Successfully populated via `scripts/add_mock_recipes_and_ingredients.py`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection working, recipes stored with user_id=111
- **Health Check**: Backend responding correctly on port 8001

### ❌ Frontend Issues (Critical)
- **API Configuration**: `config.ts` defaults to port 8002 when environment variable not set
- **Environment Setup**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` not configured in development environment
- **Recipe Display Flow**: `fetchMyRecipes()` in `RecipesContainer.tsx` likely calling wrong endpoint
- **Console Logging**: Limited debugging information for API connectivity issues

### 🟡 Authentication Issues (Partial)
- **User Context**: Hardcoded user_id=111 throughout app but may be inconsistent
- **AuthContext**: Has TODO comments for proper authentication integration
- **API Calls**: Some endpoints may not be passing user_id parameter correctly

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Emergency Fix (30 minutes)
1. **Set correct API URL**: Export `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1` before starting iOS app
2. **Restart iOS app**: Ensure frontend connects to port 8001 where backend is running
3. **Test My Recipes tab**: Verify recipes now display in UI

### Phase 2: Validation (1 hour)
1. **Add debug logging**: Enhance `RecipesContainer.tsx` with detailed API call logging
2. **Verify API responses**: Confirm frontend receives and processes recipe data correctly
3. **Test filtering**: Ensure Saved/Cooked tabs and rating filters work properly

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (2 hours)  
1. **Test recipe saving**: Add save buttons to Pantry/Discover tabs
2. **Verify user context**: Ensure all API calls use consistent user_id
3. **End-to-end testing**: Complete recipe discovery → save → view in My Recipes workflow

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY - My Recipes Fix

The top priority is resolving the **API port mismatch** preventing My Recipes from displaying. This is a configuration issue, not a code problem:

1. **Immediate Fix**: Set environment variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1`
2. **Restart Frontend**: iOS app will now connect to correct backend port
3. **Verify Data Flow**: 100 mock recipes should display in My Recipes tab
4. **Test Functionality**: Saved/Cooked tabs and filters should work properly
