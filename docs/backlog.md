# PrepSense Development Backlog

## Sprint Audit - August 1, 2025

| ID | Title | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Fix Recipes Screen Header Gap | Done | dankimjw | Fixed visual gap between main PrepSense header and recipes subheader - eliminated duplicate padding in recipes.tsx |
| 2 | Resolve My Recipes Image Loading | Done | dankimjw | Implemented getRecipeImageUri() helper with fallback chain: recipe_image → recipe_data.image → placeholder |
| 3 | Standardize Recipe Details Display | Done | dankimjw | Added normalizeRecipeData() function in RecipeDetailCardV3.tsx to handle multiple recipe data formats consistently |
| 4 | Fix recipesData ReferenceError | Done | dankimjw | 2025-07-31: Imported useTabData hook, replaced undefined variable references with memoized values |
| 5 | Claude Hooks Configuration Fix | Done | dankimjw | 2025-07-31: Fixed hook errors by updating to absolute paths and uv commands, created worktree setup script |
| 6 | Refactor Recipes Screen Component | Todo | - | Split the 1900+ line recipes.tsx file into 4 focused components: RecipesContainer (~300 lines), RecipesTabs (~200 lines), RecipesFilters (~250 lines), RecipesList (~350 lines). Implement useReducer pattern and comprehensive test coverage. |
| 7 | Mock Data Cleanup in Recipes | Todo | - | Remove 42 lines of commented-out mock recipes from recipes.tsx to improve code clarity |
| 8 | API Parameter Standardization | Todo | - | Fix parameter naming consistency (camelCase → snake_case) in recipe service API calls |
| 9 | Implement Authentication Integration for Recipe Management | Todo | backend | Replace hardcoded user_id=111 with proper authentication throughout recipe endpoints |
| 10 | Add Recipe Completion UI Integration | Todo | frontend | Integrate the existing mark-as-cooked endpoint into the recipes screen UI |
| 11 | Implement Shopping List Integration for Missing Ingredients | Todo | frontend | Add functionality to automatically add missing recipe ingredients to shopping list |
| 12 | Add Spoonacular API Rate Limiting | Todo | backend | Implement rate limiting and quota management for Spoonacular API calls |
| 13 | Test Recipe UI/UX Fixes | Todo | - | Verify all three recipe fixes work correctly with real chat-generated recipe data |
| 14 | Recipe Performance Optimization | Todo | - | Consider lazy loading for recipe images and virtualized lists for large recipe collections |
| 15 | Recipe Search Enhancement | Todo | - | Add semantic search capabilities for better recipe discovery |
| 16 | Recipe Accessibility Improvements | Todo | - | Add screen reader support and keyboard navigation for recipe components |
| 17 | Recipe Caching Strategy | Todo | - | Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed recipes to reduce API calls |
| 18 | Implement Recipe Image Optimization | Todo | frontend | Add image caching, lazy loading, and compression for recipe images |
| 19 | Add Offline Recipe Support | Todo | frontend | Implement offline caching mechanism for saved recipes and recently viewed recipes |
| 20 | Expose AI Recipe Recommendations in UI | Todo | frontend | Integrate existing AI recipe recommendation system into the recipes screen UI |
| 21 | Add Ingredient Substitution Suggestions | Todo | backend | Implement ingredient substitution suggestions for missing ingredients in recipes |
| 22 | Implement Advanced Error Recovery | Todo | frontend | Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic for recipe API calls |
| 23 | Add Recipe Search Performance Optimization | Todo | backend | Implement search result caching, pagination, and indexing for complex recipe searches |

## Files Modified in Recent Fixes

### Core Recipe Components
- `/ios-app/app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` - Fixed header gap, image loading, and ReferenceError (currently 1902 lines, pending refactoring)
- `/ios-app/components/recipes/RecipeDetailCardV3.tsx` - Added recipe data normalization 
- `/ios-app/services/recipeService.ts` - Enhanced Recipe interface for multiple formats
- `/ios-app/app/_layout.tsx` - Header integration fixes

### Key Improvements Implemented
1. **Header Integration**: Seamless visual flow between main header and recipe subheader
2. **Image Fallback Chain**: Robust image loading for both Spoonacular and chat-generated recipes
3. **Data Normalization**: Flexible parsing of recipe data from multiple sources (Spoonacular, chat-generated)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Next Sprint Priorities
1. **Major Refactoring**: Complete the recipes screen component split (Task #6) - high priority due to maintainability concerns
2. **Code Cleanup**: Remove mock data and standardize API parameters (Tasks #7, #8)
3. **Authentication Integration**: Replace hardcoded user IDs with proper auth (Task #9)
4. **Testing Phase**: Validate fixes with real chat-generated recipe data (Task #13)
5. **Performance**: Optimize recipe loading and rendering (Task #14)

## Technical Debt
- **CRITICAL**: recipes.tsx is still 1900+ lines and needs urgent refactoring
- Recipe interface could be simplified once data format standardization is complete
- Consider consolidating recipe service methods for better maintainability
- UI components could benefit from shared styling constants
- API parameter naming inconsistencies need resolution

## Implementation Status - Refactoring Task
- **Current State**: recipes.tsx remains at 1902 lines
- **Target Components**: 4 focused components totaling ~1100 lines
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite needed (85-92% coverage target)
- **State Management**: useReducer pattern to replace 12+ useState hooks
- **Priority**: High - maintainability and developer experience improvement

## Dependencies & Requirements
- All fixes maintain compatibility with existing Spoonacular API integration
- Chat-generated recipe format must be validated against normalizeRecipeData() function
- Performance testing needed for large recipe collections (100+ items)
- Refactoring must preserve all existing functionality
- Test coverage must be maintained during component split
