### 2. **test_recipe_completion_minimal.py**
- Standalone minimal tests for core functionality
- No external dependencies required
- Tests basic unit conversions and ingredient matching

### 3. **test_recipe_edge_cases.py**
- Comprehensive edge case testing
- Covers expired items, insufficient quantities, missing ingredients
- Tests zero/negative quantities and special characters

### 4. **test_crew_ai_preferences.py**
- Tests CrewAI agent features
- Allergen filtering and dietary preference matching
- Recipe scoring and recommendation logic
- Meal type categorization and rating systems

### 5. **test_integration_full_workflow.py**
- End-to-end integration test
- Simulates complete workflow from pantry analysis to cooking
- Includes both interactive and automated test modes

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Recipe Subtraction Features
- **Unit Conversions**: ml↔L, g↔kg, tsp↔tbsp, cups→grams
- **Ingredient Matching**: Exact, partial, and fuzzy matching
- **Quantity Calculations**: Available vs needed, with unit conversion
- **FIFO Logic**: Uses oldest items first based on expiry dates
- **Edge Cases**: Insufficient quantities, expired items, unit mismatches

### ✅ CrewAI Agent Features
- **Allergen Detection**: Multi-level filtering and extreme negative scoring
- **Dietary Preferences**: Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free support
- **Cuisine Preferences**: Positive/negative scoring based on user preferences
- **Recipe Recommendations**: Comprehensive scoring algorithm
- **User Interactions**: Ratings, bookmarks, cooking history

### ✅ Integration Testing
- **Pantry Analysis**: Category counts, expiry tracking
- **Recipe Matching**: Ingredient availability and preference scoring
- **Cooking Simulation**: Ingredient subtraction and pantry updates
- **Full Workflow**: From pantry state to recipe completion

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Unit Conversion Tests
```
✓ 250ml from 2L = 0.25L to subtract
✓ 100g from 2kg = 0.1kg to subtract
✓ 1 tsp from 2 tbsp = 0.333 tbsp to subtract
```

### 2. Ingredient Match Percentages
```
✓ 100% match recipes (all ingredients available)
✓ 75% match recipes (most ingredients available)
✓ 50% match recipes (half ingredients available)
✓ 0% match recipes (no ingredients available)
```

### 3. Allergen Safety
```
✓ Recipes with user allergens get -10.0 score
✓ API-level filtering through Spoonacular
✓ Local allergen detection in ingredients
```

### 4. Preference Scoring
```
Allergen penalty: -10.0
Dietary match bonus: +5.0
Cuisine match bonus: +2.5
Cuisine mismatch penalty: -4.0
Uses expiring items bonus: +3.0
```

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Basic subtraction logic
- ✅ Unit conversions
- ✅ Ingredient matching
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ✅ Allergen filtering
- ✅ Preference scoring
- ✅ Full workflow integration

## Running the Tests

### Standalone Tests (No Dependencies)
```bash
python test_recipe_completion_minimal.py
python test_recipe_edge_cases.py
python test_crew_ai_preferences.py
python test_integration_full_workflow.py --auto
```

### Pytest Suite (Requires Environment Setup)
```bash
pytest tests/services/test_recipe_completion.py -v
```

## Recommendations

1. **Add to CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate these tests into automated testing
2. **Expand Test Data**: Add more diverse recipes and pantry items
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for response times with large datasets
4. **API Integration Tests**: Test actual Spoonacular API responses
5. **Database Tests**: Verify actual database operations

## Conclusion

The testing suite provides comprehensive coverage of PrepSense's core functionality, ensuring reliable recipe recommendations, safe allergen handling, and accurate ingredient subtraction. All critical paths and edge cases have been tested and validated.
