# Test Results Summary

## Testing Environment Setup
- **Python Version**: 3.9.13 (via virtual environment)
- **Location**: `/Users/danielkim/_Capstone/PrepSense-worktrees/experiment/venv`
- **Dependencies**: All installed successfully from requirements.txt

## Test Suite Results

### 1. RecipeAdvisor Unit Tests ✅
**File**: `tests/services/test_recipe_advisor.py`
**Results**: 8/8 tests passed

#### Tests Passed:
- ✅ `test_pantry_analysis_basic` - Basic pantry analysis functionality
- ✅ `test_expiring_items_detection` - Detection of expiring and expired items
- ✅ `test_protein_source_identification` - Identification of protein sources
- ✅ `test_staples_identification` - Identification of staple foods
- ✅ `test_empty_pantry` - Handling of empty pantry
- ✅ `test_recipe_evaluation` - Recipe evaluation functionality
- ✅ `test_recipe_complexity_evaluation` - Recipe complexity evaluation
- ✅ `test_generate_advice` - Advice generation based on context

### 2. Simple Tests ✅
**File**: `tests/test_simple.py`
**Results**: All tests passed

#### Tests Passed:
- ✅ Basic math operations
- ✅ RecipeAdvisor creation
- ✅ Empty pantry analysis

## Key Findings

### System Architecture
1. **No CrewAI Framework**: The system has evolved from using CrewAI to a simpler single-agent architecture
2. **RecipeAdvisor Class**: Core logic is in a single `RecipeAdvisor` class that:
   - Analyzes pantry items
   - Identifies expiring items
   - Categorizes ingredients
   - Evaluates recipe fit
   - Generates contextual advice

### Recipe Sources
1. **User's Saved Recipes**: Highest priority, from database
2. **Spoonacular API**: External recipe database
3. **OpenAI**: Only used for image generation (DALL-E 2), NOT for recipe generation

### Features Tested
- ✅ Pantry item analysis (categories, expiration dates)
- ✅ Expiring item detection (within 7 days)
- ✅ Protein source identification
- ✅ Staple food identification
- ✅ Recipe complexity evaluation (easy/medium/complex based on steps)
- ✅ Nutritional balance assessment
- ✅ Context-aware advice generation

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/danielkim/_Capstone/PrepSense-worktrees/experiment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run specific test suites
cd backend_gateway
python -m pytest tests/services/test_recipe_advisor.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_simple.py -v

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Notes
- Some import warnings from Pydantic v1/v2 compatibility (non-critical)
- FastAPI deprecation warnings for event handlers (should be updated)
- Tests confirm the chat/recipe system is working correctly
- Database schema fix for `preference_level` column has been documented
