# Spoonacular Client Implementation

## Overview
Created a centralized Spoonacular API client wrapper following TDD principles.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created:
1. **`backend_gateway/services/spoonacular_client.py`**
   - Main client wrapper implementation
   - Methods for all major Spoonacular endpoints
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Context manager support
   - Proper error handling

2. **`backend_gateway/tests/test_spoonacular_client_unit.py`**
   - Comprehensive unit tests using unittest
   - 13 test cases covering all methods
   - Mock-based testing for API calls
   - Tests for error handling and retries

### Key Features:
- **API Key Management**: Supports both explicit key and environment variable
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry count for timeout errors
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception propagation for HTTP and network errors
- **Context Manager**: Supports `with` statement for automatic cleanup
- **Rate Limiting**: Detects and handles rate limit responses

### Methods Implemented:
1. `search_recipes_by_ingredients()` - Find recipes by available ingredients
2. `get_recipe_information()` - Get detailed recipe data
3. `analyze_recipe_instructions()` - Get step-by-step instructions
4. `get_similar_recipes()` - Find similar recipes
5. `substitute_ingredients()` - Get ingredient substitutions

### Test Results:
```
Ran 13 tests in 3.137s
OK
```

All tests pass successfully!

### Usage Example:
```python
from backend_gateway.services.spoonacular_client import SpoonacularClient

# Using environment variable
client = SpoonacularClient()

# Or with explicit API key
client = SpoonacularClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Search recipes
recipes = client.search_recipes_by_ingredients(
    ingredients=["chicken", "rice"],
    number=5
)

# Get recipe details
recipe_info = client.get_recipe_information(
    recipe_id=123,
    include_nutrition=True
)

# Using context manager
with SpoonacularClient() as client:
    similar = client.get_similar_recipes(recipe_id=123)
```

### Integration Notes:
- The client is designed to be used by existing services
- Replace direct API calls in services with this client
- Enables better testing through dependency injection
- Centralizes API interaction logic

### Next Steps:
- Update existing services to use this client
- Create similar wrappers for OpenAI and CrewAI
- Write integration tests with actual API calls
