# My Recipes Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive "My Recipes" feature that allows users to save, rate, and track their recipe usage.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema (✅ COMPLETED)
- Created enhanced `user_recipes` table in BigQuery with 24 fields
- Added metadata fields: prep_time, cook_time, servings, difficulty
- Added categorization: cuisine, dish_type, diet_labels, tags
- Added tracking: times_cooked, last_cooked_at
- Added user interaction: notes, rating (thumbs_up/down)

### 2. Backend Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)

#### Services (`user_recipes_service.py`)
- `save_recipe()` - Saves recipes with automatic metadata extraction from Spoonacular
- `get_user_recipes()` - Retrieves recipes with optional rating filter
- `update_recipe_rating()` - Updates thumbs up/down ratings
- `delete_user_recipe()` - Removes recipes from collection
- `check_recipe_exists()` - Prevents duplicate saves
- `increment_times_cooked()` - Tracks recipe usage
- `get_user_recipe_stats()` - Provides user analytics

#### API Endpoints (`user_recipes_router.py`)
- `POST /api/v1/user-recipes` - Save a recipe
- `GET /api/v1/user-recipes` - Get saved recipes (with filtering)
- `PUT /api/v1/user-recipes/{id}/rating` - Update rating
- `DELETE /api/v1/user-recipes/{id}` - Delete recipe
- `POST /api/v1/user-recipes/{id}/cooked` - Mark as cooked
- `GET /api/v1/user-recipes/stats` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/v1/user-recipes/check/{recipe_id}` - Check if saved

### 3. Frontend Implementation (✅ COMPLETED)

#### UI Updates (`recipes.tsx`)
- Added "My Recipes" tab to the main recipes screen
- Added save button (bookmark icon) on all recipe cards
- Added thumbs up/down buttons on saved recipes
- Added delete button (trash icon) on saved recipes
- Added filtering: All, Liked, Disliked

#### Features
- Seamless recipe saving from any source (search, pantry, random)
- Real-time rating updates
- Persistent storage in BigQuery
- Authentication-protected (requires login)

## Testing Results

Successfully tested all functionality:
- ✅ Recipe saving with metadata extraction
- ✅ Recipe retrieval and filtering
- ✅ Rating updates
- ✅ Statistics aggregation
- ✅ JSON data storage and retrieval

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Browse recipes in any tab (From Pantry, Search, Discover)
2. Click the bookmark icon to save a recipe
3. Go to "My Recipes" tab to see saved recipes
4. Use thumbs up/down to rate recipes
5. Filter by All/Liked/Disliked
6. Click trash icon to remove recipes

### For Developers:
1. The table is already created in BigQuery
2. Backend endpoints are ready at `/api/v1/user-recipes/*`
3. Frontend is fully integrated
4. Test using the scripts in `backend_gateway/scripts/`

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Recipe Recommendations**: Use the rating data to suggest similar recipes
2. **Social Features**: Share recipes with other users
3. **Meal Planning**: Use saved recipes to create weekly meal plans
4. **Shopping Lists**: Generate shopping lists from saved recipes
5. **Cooking History**: Show detailed cooking history and trends
6. **Recipe Collections**: Organize recipes into custom collections

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- `/backend_gateway/services/user_recipes_service.py` (NEW)
- `/backend_gateway/routers/user_recipes_router.py` (NEW)
- `/backend_gateway/app.py` (MODIFIED - added router)
- `/backend_gateway/sql/create_or_update_user_recipes_table.sql` (NEW)
- `/backend_gateway/sql/README_user_recipes_setup.md` (NEW)
- `/backend_gateway/scripts/setup_user_recipes_table.py` (NEW)
- `/backend_gateway/scripts/test_user_recipes.py` (NEW)

### Frontend:
- `/ios-app/app/(tabs)/recipes.tsx` (MODIFIED - added My Recipes tab)

## Technical Details

### Database Connection
- The `user_recipes` table properly references the `user` table via INTEGER user_id
- Maintains consistency with existing schema patterns
- Uses BigQuery's JSON type for flexible recipe data storage

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes are automatically managed by BigQuery
- Views created for common query patterns
- Efficient filtering and pagination supported

### Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own recipes
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
