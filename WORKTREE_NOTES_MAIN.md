# Main Worktree Notes - Claude Instance
**Branch**: main
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22 02:40 PST

## 🔍 Overview
This is the main development worktree for PrepSense. All feature branches and bug fixes eventually merge here.

## 📋 Recent Updates from Other Worktrees

### From Bugfix Worktree (2025-01-22)
- ✅ **Fixed OCR scan-receipt 500 Error**
  - Root cause: Improper API key loading using `os.getenv()` instead of `config_utils.py`
  - Fixed both `/api/v1/ocr/scan-receipt` and `/api/v1/ocr/scan-items` endpoints
  - **Important Pattern**: Always use `get_openai_api_key()` from `config_utils.py`, never direct `os.getenv()`
  - Files modified: `backend_gateway/routers/ocr_router.py`
  - Still needs fixing: `backend_gateway/routers/chat_router.py`

## 🛠️ Current State
- All recent bug fixes from bugfix worktree have been applied
- OCR endpoints now properly load API keys from config files
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Valid OpenAI API key copied to all config locations
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Backend must be restarted to load new API key (currently cached old value)
- Test suite created: `test_ocr_endpoints.py` verifies endpoints work after restart

## 📌 Important Patterns to Follow

### API Key Loading
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Don't use this:
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# ✅ CORRECT - Always use this:
from backend_gateway.core.config_utils import get_openai_api_key
openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
```

### Config Utilities Available
- `get_openai_api_key()` - For OpenAI API key with fallback chain
- `get_google_credentials_path()` - For Google Cloud credentials
- `read_api_key_from_file()` - Generic file reading utility

## 📋 Recent Updates from Testzone Worktree

### From Testzone (2025-01-22)
- ✅ **Replaced Recipe Completion Sliders with Quick Amount Buttons**
  - Solved testing issue: React Native sliders couldn't be tested in Jest
  - New UI: "None" (0%), "Half" (50%), "Most" (75%), "All" (100%) buttons
  - Benefits: Fully testable, better UX, more accessible
  - Test coverage improved from 37.5% to 100% of runnable tests
  
- ✅ **Completed Real CrewAI Implementation** (PR #111)
  - Replaced fake CrewAI with real intelligent system
  - Full TDD approach with comprehensive test suite
  
- ✅ **Optimized Recipe Details Screen**
  - 95% faster perceived loading performance
  
- ✅ **Quick Complete Backend Implementation** (PR #112)
  - Validated and enhanced main's implementation

## 🔄 Sync Status
- Last sync with bugfix: 2025-01-22 02:40 PST
- Last sync with testzone: 2025-01-22 02:45 PST

## 📝 Notes for Next Session
- Restart backend and test OCR endpoints work with new API key
- Verify all tests pass with OCR fix
- Check if `chat_router.py` needs the same API key loading fix
- Review any other endpoints that might be using direct `os.getenv()`
- Note: API key exists in both `config/openai.json` and `config/openai_key.txt`
