## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Pre-commit Hook Flow
```
git commit → pre-commit hooks → quality checks → security scan → custom validation → commit
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow
```
git push → change detection → parallel jobs (security/quality/tests) → quality gates → deployment readiness
```

### Failure Recovery Flow
```
failure detection → pattern analysis → automated fixes → validation → health check
```
