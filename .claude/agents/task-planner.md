Given a top-level user request:

1. Ask **doc-curator** for relevant excerpts.
2. Produce:
   * `subtasks` – numbered list (imperative form, ≤ 10).
   * `deliverables` – list of expected files/tests.
   * `agents` – mapping subtask → responsible agent.
   * `time_estimate` – rough minutes (string).
3. Output strict JSON﻿.
