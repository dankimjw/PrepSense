# Testzone Worktree Notes - Claude Instance
**Branch**: fix-shopping-list-fractions  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-19 12:15 PST

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Fix shopping list fraction display bugs
- Verify findings from Main instance (React testing, backend errors)
- Test and validate code changes across instances
- Collaborate on improving code quality and test coverage

## 📋 Task Log

### 2025-01-19 - Initial Collaboration Setup
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Understanding the collaboration system:
1. Reading all worktree notes to understand current state
2. Planning verification tasks for Main instance findings
3. Setting up to investigate shopping list fraction issues

**Planned Verifications**:
- ❓ React 19+ test-renderer deprecation (from Main)
- ❓ RecipeAdvisor backend error (from Main)

## 🤝 For Other Instances

### Collaboration Approach
As the Testzone instance, I will:
1. **Test and verify** all critical findings from Main and Bugfix
2. **Validate fixes** before they're merged
3. **Document edge cases** discovered during testing
4. **Share test results** with clear reproduction steps

### Questions for Main Instance:
- What specific React 19 project did you test the renderer deprecation in?
- Are there other test files affected by the react-test-renderer issue?

### Questions for Bugfix Instance:
- Are you planning to investigate the RecipeAdvisor backend error?
- Any specific recipe quality improvements you're working on?

## 🔄 Collaboration Strategy

### How I'll Stay Updated:
1. **Regular Check-ins**: Read all WORKTREE_NOTES_*.md every 30 minutes
2. **Before Starting Tasks**: Always check latest notes to avoid duplication
3. **After Completing Tasks**: Update my notes immediately with results
4. **Watch for Updates**: Look for ❓, ⚠️, and 🚫 markers from other instances

### My Communication Commitments:
1. **Document Everything**: 
   - Test commands with exact syntax
   - Full error messages and stack traces
   - Successful test outputs
   - Environment details (versions, configs)

2. **Flag for Verification**:
   - Mark uncertain findings with ❓
   - Request specific instance verification
   - Include reproduction steps

3. **Rapid Response**:
   - When I see "Needs verification by Testzone", prioritize it
   - Test within 15 minutes of seeing request
   - Report results in both their notes and mine

### Collaboration Patterns:
1. **With Main Instance**:
   - Verify their implementations work correctly
   - Test their new features comprehensively
   - Report edge cases they might have missed
   
2. **With Bugfix Instance**:
   - Test their bug fixes thoroughly
   - Verify fixes don't break other features
   - Help reproduce bugs they're investigating

3. **Cross-Verification**:
   - If Main says "tests pass", I run them independently
   - If Bugfix says "error fixed", I create tests to prove it
   - Document any discrepancies found

### Knowledge Sharing Format:
