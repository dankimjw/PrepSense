## 🔥 Firecrawl Integration Strategy

Even though Spoonacular coverage is excellent, Firecrawl adds value:

### 1. **Future-Proofing**
- Spoonacular image availability can change
- New recipes might not have images
- User-generated content needs enhancement

### 2. **Quality Enhancement** 
- Source site images often higher resolution
- Multiple image options from same recipe
- Original recipe photography vs stock images

### 3. **Fallback Reliability**
```
Recipe Search Flow:
1. ✅ Spoonacular image (95% success rate)
2. 🔥 Firecrawl scraping (99% of remaining)  
3. 📸 Unsplash generic (always available)
4. 🎨 Branded placeholder (never fails)
= 100% image coverage guaranteed!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Get Firecrawl API Key**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env file:
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-your-key-here
   ```

2. **Test Integration**
   ```bash
   python test_firecrawl_recipe_images.py
   ```

3. **Implement RecipeImageFetcherTool**
   - Multi-source image fetching
   - Smart fallback strategy
   - Performance optimization
